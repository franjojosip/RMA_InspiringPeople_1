# Inspiring people Kotlin application


This is application contains two activities. First one is using Recycler view to show list of inspiring people, and a second activity
has a form which contains fields with basic information and upload image button for adding a new inspiring person. Image is uploaded from local storage and it needs to check permission before opening storage with photos. New inspiring person which is submitted from "Add new inspiring person" activity will trigger refresh on Recycler view after coming back from second activity.
